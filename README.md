# About this project

Welcome!  This coding project was made for my C++ 2 course in 2024. 

This project represents the basic functionality of an app that allows the user to book hiking trips across the United States and use their membershio points to get discounts on trips.

Huge thanks to my classmate/teammate, Max, who helped me create this capstone project, and my CS professor for guidance.
